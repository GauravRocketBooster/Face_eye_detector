# Overview
A simple face detector and eye detector made using opencv and publicly available haarcascade files. Run the face_detector.py file to run. 

# Requirements

You need the opencv installed on your machine. If you don't have opencv, assuming you have Python installed properly and pip configured, running the "pip install opencv-python" command will install the opencv library.

I recommend having a look at the opencv official docs, in order to get a better understanding of what the library is all about, and know more about Computer Vision.
